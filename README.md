# burger

This is the 11th homework assignment for the University of Richmond Coding Bootcamp.

For this assignment, we were asked to create an application that would let users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Once submitted, the application will display the burger on the left side--waiting to be devoured. When the user clicks the "Devour" button, the burger will move to the right side of the page. All burgers are displayed in the database.
